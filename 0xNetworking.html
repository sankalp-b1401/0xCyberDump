<p>Any set of things that are <ins>interconnected</ins> form a <em><strong>network</strong></em>. For instance, consider a group of friends: they can share resources, communicate, give and take amongst each other - so does the devices that are connected to a <ins>digital network</ins>.</p>

<p><strong>ARPANET</strong>(Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was the first wide area packet-switched network constructed in 1969 to transmit sensitive military data and to connect leading research groups throughout the United States.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET"><sup>[1]</sup></a><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Arpanet"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. He also created the HTML, the URL system and the HTTP. In short, he created the internet as we know. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee"><sup>[3]</sup></a><a href="https://home.cern/science/computing/birth-web"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<li><strong>Internet</strong> is the network of networks.</li>
<li>It is a global network of interconnected computers and devices that allows users to access and share information and devices, allowing them to communicate and exchange data. It enables users to access a wide range of services, such as <ins>websites</ins>, <ins>emails</ins>, <ins>social media</ins>, <ins>online applications</ins>, and <ins>cloud storage</ins>.</li>
<li>Internet is a public network.</li>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>PAN</strong> (Personal Area Network)</td>
<td>A network centered around an individual for personal device connection</td>
<td>Typically within 10 meters</td>
<td>5-10 devices</td>
<td>Easy to set up, low cost, highly mobile</td>
<td>Limited range, low data transfer rates, security concerns</td>
<td>Bluetooth, Infrared, ZigBee, USB</td>
<td>Connecting smartphone, smartwatch, and wireless earbuds</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>LAN</strong> (Local Area Network)</td>
<td>A network covering a small geographic area like a home, office, or school</td>
<td>Up to ~1 km</td>
<td>Typically up to 1,000 hosts, but can scale</td>
<td>High speed, low latency, inexpensive for small areas, easier maintenance</td>
<td>Limited to a small geographic area, can become congested with many devices</td>
<td>Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Token Ring</td>
<td>Home Wi-Fi, Office network</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>CAN</strong> (Campus Area Network)</td>
<td>Interconnects multiple LANs within a campus like universities or business parks</td>
<td>Typically up to 10 km</td>
<td>Thousands of hosts</td>
<td>Connects multiple buildings efficiently, cost-effective for large organizations</td>
<td>Limited to campus, not suited for larger geographical areas</td>
<td>Fiber optics, Ethernet, Wi-Fi</td>
<td>University network connecting departments and libraries</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>MAN</strong> (Metropolitan Area Network)</td>
<td>Covers a city or large campus, connecting multiple LANs and CANs</td>
<td>Up to ~50 km</td>
<td>Tens of thousands of hosts</td>
<td>High-speed connections over a large area, interconnects multiple sites</td>
<td>More expensive, requires more management, potential for higher latency than LAN</td>
<td>Fiber optics, wireless bridges, MPLS</td>
<td>City-wide public Wi-Fi, cable TV networks</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>WAN</strong> (Wide Area Network)</td>
<td>Spans large geographical areas, often country or continent-wide</td>
<td>Unlimited (Global)</td>
<td>Millions of hosts</td>
<td>Connects remote locations, facilitates global communication</td>
<td>Expensive, complex management, high latency compared to LANs</td>
<td>MPLS, leased lines, satellites, VPNs, Internet backbone technologies</td>
<td>The Internet, multinational corporate networks</td>
