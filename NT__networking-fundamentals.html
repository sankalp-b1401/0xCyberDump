            <p>
                In a general sense, networking means to build and maintain relationships(connections) in order to:
                <ul class="custom-list">
                    <li>exchange information(data) & resources</li>
                    <li>support</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Networks are simply things connected. For example, your friendship circle: you are all connected because of similar interests,
                hobbies, skills and sorts. Networks are not just limited to a computing concepts they can be observed in real-life cases:
                <ol>
                    <li>A city's public transportation system</li>
                    <li>Infrastructure such as the national power grid for electricity</li>
                    <li>Meeting and greeting your neighbours</li>
                    <li>Postal systems for sending letters and parcels</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>In context of computing, networking is the same idea, just dispersed to technological devices.</p>

                A network comprises of four main components:

            <p>
                Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP)to communicate between networks and devices. It is a <u>network of networks</u> that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies.

                <h2><u>ARPANET - The First Internet</u></h2>
                <p>
                    The first iteration of the Internet was within the <u>Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET)</u> project in the late 1960s. It was the first documented network in action. The project began with the Department of Defense’s Advanced Research Projects Agency, then called ARPA and now DARPA. The initial network of only four computers at different locations conducted research in wide-area networking. SRI hosted one of the four original network nodes, along with the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA); the University of California, Santa Barbara; and the University of Utah. The very first transmission on the ARPANET was on October 29, 1969.

                <p>
                    <u>Purpose</u>: ARPANET was initially designed to facilitate communication and resource sharing between research institutions and government agencies.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <u>Key Innovations</u>:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Packet Switching: This revolutionary concept involved breaking down data into smaller packets, transmitting them independently, and reassembling them at the destination. This allowed for more efficient and reliable data transmission compared to older circuit-switching methods.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            TCP/IP Protocol Suite: ARPANET was one of the first networks to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite, which is the foundation of the internet's communication system.
                        </li>
                    </ol> 
                </p>

                <p>
                    <u>Evolution</u>: ARPANET evolved over time, growing from a small network of four computers to a larger network connecting various research institutions. It eventually transitioned into the internet as we know it today. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    <u>Legacy</u>: ARPANET's development laid the groundwork for the global internet, impacting communication, information sharing, and technological advancement significantly. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    <u>Significance</u>: ARPANET demonstrated the feasibility of packet switching and the TCP/IP protocol, paving the way for the development of a global network of interconnected computers.

                <p>
                    The World Wide Web (WWW) was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. He originally developed it to facilitate information sharing among scientists. He developed the code for his Web server on a NeXT computer. To prevent it being accidentally switched off, the computer had a hand-written label in red ink: <span id="text-in-red">"This machine is a server. DO NOT POWER IT DOWN!!"</span>
                </p>

                <p>The first web page was: <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html</a></p>

                <p>
                    This page contained links to information about the WWW project itself, including a description of hypertext, technical details for creating a Web server, and links to other Web servers as they became available. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The key components created were URLs, HTTP, and HTML. The first website, dedicated to the WWW project, was hosted on his NeXT computer at CERN.

                <ol>
                    Key aspects of the invention:
                    <li>
                        Conception and Development: The initial proposal for the system was made in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, and further refined by him and Robert Cailliau in 1990.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Core Technologies: The WWW relies on three main technologies:
                        <ul>
                            <li>URLs (Uniform Resource Locators): These are the addresses used to locate resources on the web.</li>
                            <li>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): This protocol enables the communication between web servers and clients.</li>
                            <li>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): This language formats web pages, including the hypertext links.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Open and Accessible: A crucial aspect of the WWW's success was its open and accessible nature. CERN made the software available in the public domain in 1993.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Impact: The World Wide Web transformed how information is accessed, shared, and communicated, impacting various aspects of society and culture.
